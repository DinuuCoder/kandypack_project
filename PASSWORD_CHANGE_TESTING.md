# Password Change Modal - Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### What Was Built

#### 1. PasswordChangeModal Component
**Location**: `Frontend/src/components/PasswordChangeModal.js`

**Features**:
- ✅ Current password field with visibility toggle
- ✅ New password field with strength indicator
- ✅ Password requirements checklist (live validation)
- ✅ Confirm password field with match validation
- ✅ Optional username change field
- ✅ Beautiful gradient UI with animations
- ✅ Cannot be closed without changing password (forced modal)
- ✅ Real-time error messages
- ✅ Loading state during submission

**Password Requirements**:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one symbol (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)

**Password Strength Levels**:
- **Weak** (Red) - 0-2 requirements met
- **Medium** (Orange) - 3-4 requirements met
- **Strong** (Green) - All 5 requirements met

#### 2. AuthContext Integration
**Location**: `Frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js`

**Added Functions**:
- `changePassword(passwordData)` - Calls backend API based on user role
- Captures `must_change_password` flag from login response
- Updates user data after successful password change
- Removes `must_change_password` flag after change

#### 3. Auth Service Updates
**Location**: `Frontend/src/services/auth.service.js`

**Added Methods**:
- `authService.driver.changePassword(driverId, passwordData)`
- `authService.assistant.changePassword(assistantId, passwordData)`

#### 4. Employee Portal Integration
**Location**: `Frontend/src/pages/Portal/EmployeePortalRouter.js`

**Behavior**:
- Checks `must_change_password` flag on mount
- Shows modal automatically for drivers/assistants
- Blocks access to dashboard until password changed
- Modal cannot be closed (no X button, no backdrop click)
- Success message after password change

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Look for these log messages:
[AuthContext:login] normalized user: { ..., must_change_password: true }
[AuthContext:changePassword] updated user: { ..., must_change_password: false }
```

### Check LocalStorage
```javascript
// Open DevTools > Application > Local Storage
// Check these keys:
authToken: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
user: {"id":1,"driver_id":"DRV001","name":"John Driver","user_name":"john","must_change_password":true,...}
```

### Backend Logs
```bash
# Check terminal running backend server
POST /api/auth/driver/login 200 - Response includes must_change_password
POST /api/drivers/DRV001/change-password 200 - Password change successful
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check driver's password was updated
SELECT driver_id, name, user_name, 
       SUBSTRING(password, 1, 10) as password_preview,
       must_change_password 
FROM driver 
WHERE driver_id = 'DRV001';

-- Expected after password change:
-- must_change_password = 0 (false)
-- password = new bcrypt hash (different from $2a$12$LQv3c1yqBWVHxkd0LHAkCO...)
```

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && node server.js`
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd Frontend && npm start`
3. **Open Browser**: http://localhost:3001/login/employee
4. **Test Driver Login**: john / Welcome123!
5. **Watch Modal Appear**: Change password and test flow!

**Note**: All existing employees in the database have `must_change_password = 1`, so the modal will appear for all of them on first login.
