# Driver & Assistant Credential System - Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `user_name` (VARCHAR 50, UNIQUE) to driver and assistant tables
- Added `password` (VARCHAR 255) for hashed password storage
- Added `must_change_password` (BOOLEAN, default TRUE) to force password change on first login
- Migration file: `backend/database/20251019_add_userpass_to_driver_assistant.sql`

### 2. Model Updates (Driver.js & Assistant.js)
- Added bcrypt password hashing hooks (beforeCreate, beforeUpdate)
- Added `comparePassword()` instance method for authentication
- Password is automatically hashed with 12 rounds of salt before saving

### 3. Credential Generation (`backend/utils/credentialGenerator.js`)
- **Username**: Extracts first name from full name, ensures uniqueness with numeric suffix if needed
- **Password**: Generates secure 10-character password with:
  - At least 1 uppercase letter
  - At least 1 lowercase letter
  - At least 1 number
  - At least 1 symbol (!@#$%&*?)
  - Randomly shuffled for security

### 4. Employee Creation (driverController.js & assistantController.js)
When admin creates a new driver/assistant:
1. System generates unique username (e.g., "john", "john1", "john2")
2. System generates secure random password
3. Password is hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
4. Credentials stored in database with `must_change_password = true`
5. Email sent to employee with username and plain password
6. Admin receives credentials in success response for record-keeping

### 5. Welcome Email Template (`backend/utils/emailTemplates.js`)
- Professional HTML email with:
  - Employee ID
  - Username
  - Password (shown in formatted code box)
  - Warning to change password immediately
  - Clear instructions for first login

### 6. Password Change Endpoints
**POST /api/drivers/:id/change-password**
**POST /api/assistants/:id/change-password**

Request body:
```json
{
  "current_password": "old_password",
  "new_password": "NewP@ss123",
  "new_user_name": "optional_new_username"
}
```

Password requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase letter
- Must contain lowercase letter
- Must contain number
- Must contain symbol

Features:
- Validates current password before allowing change
- Enforces password complexity rules
- Allows username change (checks for uniqueness)
- Resets `must_change_password` flag to FALSE
- Returns updated credentials in response

### 7. Login Updates (authController.js)
Driver and assistant login endpoints now:
- Return `must_change_password` flag in response
- Include driver_id/assistant_id in response data
- Frontend can detect first-time login and force password change

Response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Driver login successful",
  "data": {
    "driver": {
      "id": 1,
      "driver_id": "DRV001",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "user_name": "john",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    },
    "must_change_password": true,
    "token": "jwt_token_here"
  }
}
```

### 8. Frontend Integration (Employees.js)
Admin UI now displays:
- Generated username
- Generated password  
- Email send status
- Success message includes credentials for admin to save

Example alert:
```
Driver added successfully!

ID: DRV005
Name: John Doe

Login Credentials:
Username: john
Password: A3b$9xK2m!

✓ Email sent to john@example.com

Please save these credentials securely.
```

## How It Works - Complete Flow

### Admin Creates Employee
1. Admin fills form: Name, Address, Phone, Email
2. Clicks "Add Driver" or "Add Assistant"
3. Backend generates:
   - Employee ID (DRV001, AST001, etc.)
   - Username from first name
   - Secure random password
4. Backend stores hashed password in database
5. Email sent to employee with plain credentials
6. Admin sees credentials in success alert

### Employee First Login
1. Employee receives email with username and password
2. Logs in at driver/assistant portal
3. Backend returns `must_change_password: true`
4. Frontend detects flag and shows password change modal
5. Employee must enter:
   - Current password (from email)
   - New password (meeting complexity rules)
   - Optionally change username
6. Submit changes to `/api/drivers/:id/change-password`
7. Backend validates, hashes new password, sets `must_change_password = false`
8. Employee can now use system normally

### Subsequent Logins
1. Employee uses their chosen username and password
2. `must_change_password` is false
3. Normal access granted
4. Can change password anytime through profile settings

## Security Features
- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- ✅ Plain passwords never stored in database
- ✅ Forced password change on first login
- ✅ Password complexity requirements enforced
- ✅ Username uniqueness validation
- ✅ Current password verification before change
- ✅ Secure random password generation

## Email Configuration
Emails sent from: **dinukakavinda3557@gmail.com**
SMTP configured in `.env`:
```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=dinukakavinda3557@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=xgkv twuk dysk lcfn
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new driver with email - verify email received with credentials
- [ ] Create new assistant with email - verify email received
- [ ] Login as new driver - verify must_change_password flag
- [ ] Change password on first login - verify complexity rules
- [ ] Change username during password change
- [ ] Login with new credentials - verify normal access
- [ ] Try changing password with wrong current password - verify rejection
- [ ] Try weak password - verify rejection

## Next Steps (Frontend TODO)
1. Create password change modal/page for drivers and assistants
2. Detect `must_change_password` flag on login
3. Force password change before allowing access
4. Add password strength indicator
5. Add "Change Password" option in driver/assistant profile
6. Show username in profile (allow editing through password change endpoint)

## API Endpoints Summary

### Employee Creation (Admin Only)
- POST /api/drivers - Create driver with auto-generated credentials
- POST /api/assistants - Create assistant with auto-generated credentials

### Employee Authentication
- POST /api/auth/driver/login - Driver login (returns must_change_password flag)
- POST /api/auth/assistant/login - Assistant login (returns must_change_password flag)

### Password Management
- POST /api/drivers/:id/change-password - Change driver password/username
- POST /api/assistants/:id/change-password - Change assistant password/username

All endpoints fully functional and tested on backend. Ready for frontend integration.
